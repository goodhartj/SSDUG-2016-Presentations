######Presented on Febuary 11th 2016 @ the Olympia Center in Olympia, WA

Developers are always up against rigid deadlines, sparse and changing requirements, and constant production support issues. This leaves little time for keeping up with current threats and defenses, and inevitably makes security an afterthought. One of the key strategies of Information Security is to equip developers with the tools and awareness necessary to design and write secure code. In this talk, Justin will share guidelines and security controls as well as real-world examples and implementations that you can apply to your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to reduce vulnerabilities and exploits.
